## The Python Compiler

`compiler_py` was made to speed up initial development times. 

Because it is very difficult to work with a self-compiled language without being able to run it in the first place, we use python for initial development.

Eventually, every item from within the `compiler_py` will be hand-translated into the Helium `compiler` directory.
